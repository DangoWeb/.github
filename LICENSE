Source Code Policy
Last updated: 2021-09-26
1. Is your code Open Source?
- All code that has or is managed by Dango Web Solutions is Closed Source. This means that nobody can duplicate or edit any code without direct permission from Trusted Staff. This policy applies to all code, including Public code on GitHub.

2. What happens if I steal your code?
- Since that code is ours, we have the right to file a DMCA takedown claim. We have certified legal Staff on our team to ensure that we get our code back, our code is not published by you, and that $100+ is fined to you or your company.
